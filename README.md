I choose to go for a more exploratory approach to the problem, and trained a decision tree to classify what fuel type the car uses to see what it finds the distinguishing factors are. There was moderate success, but the data was not quite diverse enough to get great results.
The only external code used was from sklearns documentation on decision trees: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html
I did consult StackOverflow, but did not use any code from it.
